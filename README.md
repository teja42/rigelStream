# rigelStream
A peer to peer, cross platfrom screen sharing tool.

It uses webRTC to share screen and uses node.js server for signalling. Really secure and private since there is no middleman
involved. You could also use this as a video chat app too. Just select the video source you want and you're good to go. 

# Note
This app is in alpha stage
